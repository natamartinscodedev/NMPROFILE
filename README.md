### Full Stack Developer

## Hi, I've been a full stack developer for over 3 years. I'm an athlete, not a professional, but my routine is very interesting. I wake up at 5:00 in the morning to run maybe 5 or 8 km with the pace on 5:00, 4:00 for 3 or 2 days a week.

## I like to play the guitar, play soccer, run in nature.
## Yes, a programmer doesn't live just by programming.
